Today, I'd like to dive into the backend architecture of the Marketplace API project. This backend, designed for managing advertisements in an online marketplace, is a testament to efficient Java and Spring Boot development

## Exploring the Marketplace API

### Introduction

The Marketplace API is a testament to my growth and understanding of backend development. This API is all about managing advertisements in an online marketplace, offering users a platform to create, update, and explore various ads.. From user registration and authentication to creating and updating advertisements, the API offers a rich set of features for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

### Features

- **User Authentication and Registration:** Secure user management ensures a smooth registration process and authenticates users effectively.
- **Advertisement Creation and Management:** Users can create and manage advertisements, providing a flexible platform for showcasing their products or services.

- **Retrieval of Active Advertisements:** A powerful feature that allows users to retrieve currently active advertisements.

- **Time-Based Advertisement Retrieval:** Users can fetch advertisements from a specified number of days ago, enhancing the flexibility of the system.

## Navigating the Documentation

### API Documentation with Swagger

Explore the capabilities of the Marketplace API using the Swagger Documentation. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure the Marketplace API is running locally.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI:

   [Swagger Documentation](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

   Note: Replace `http://localhost:8080` with the actual base URL of your running API.

3. Dive into the available endpoints, review request/response details, and interact with the API directly from the Swagger UI.

### Javadoc Documentation

For a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and implementation details, refer to the Javadoc documentation:

- [Javadoc Documentation](https://negarbaharmand.com/marketplace-docs/index.html)

The Javadoc provides comprehensive insights into the classes, methods, and overall structure of the codebase. Whether you're a developer contributing to the project or an enthusiast exploring the backend intricacies, the Javadoc is your go-to resource.

## Conclusion

Building a robust backend for a dynamic marketplace requires careful design and consideration. The Marketplace API project, with its array of features and thorough documentation, exemplifies the dedication to creating a scalable and efficient solution.
